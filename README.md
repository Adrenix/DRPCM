DRPCM is a RPC manager for Discord. This program allows users to create custom RPC statuses for unsupported games.
Simply supply a Discord application identifier, some images, some text, and you are ready to go!
This program is currently in-development and may be susceptible to bugs. The user interface may change over time, and
more features will be added.

## Download & Installation

Current releases of DRPCM can be found [here](https://github.com/Adrenix/DRPCM/releases).

Windows:

```sh
Run DRPCM.exe
```

OS X & Linux:

```sh
Not yet available
```

## Usage Example

Most games that are not available for PC - such as Splatoon 2 for Nintendo Switch - do not support RPC.
If you wanted to display your current status in Splatoon 2, all you need to do is supply the client identifier
from the application you created in the Discord Developer portal, and you're ready to go!

For more information on making applications for DRPCM, please refer to this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/Adrenix/DRPCM/wiki/Creating-RPC-Applications).

In the future, predefined RPC packs can be created and will allow you to populate RPC information automatically.
